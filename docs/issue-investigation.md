# Store Provider Module Path Investigation

## Overview

This document addresses the issue described in ZAM-128 regarding a potential incorrect path to a `store-provider` module in `server/github/probot-integration.js`.

## Investigation Findings

After a thorough investigation of the codebase, we found that:

1. The file `server/github/probot-integration.js` does not exist in the repository.
2. There are no JavaScript (`.js`) or TypeScript (`.ts`) files in the repository.
3. There is no evidence of a `store-provider` module or any probot integration in the codebase.

## Repository Structure

The repository is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for IDA Pro, which is a reverse engineering tool. The codebase is primarily Python-based with the following main components:

- `src/ida_pro_mcp/server.py`: The main MCP server implementation
- `src/ida_pro_mcp/idalib_server.py`: Server for IDA Pro via idalib
- `src/ida_pro_mcp/mcp-plugin.py`: The IDA Pro plugin that provides the JSON-RPC interface

## Conclusion

The issue described in ZAM-128 appears to be referring to a different codebase or repository. This repository does not contain the mentioned file or module.

If you intended to address an issue in a different repository, please update the issue with the correct repository information.
